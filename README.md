# K-means-Clustering

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is supervised machine 
learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and 
regression problem. It relies on the labeled input data to learn a 
function and provides output for the unlabeled unseen data.
Supervised machine learning algorithms are used to solve 
classification and regression problems.
A classification problem has a discrete value as its output whereas 
a regression problem does not have a discrete value.
The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in proximity. 
KNN algorithm works on the idea of similarity with some 
mathematics for calculating the distance between points. There 
are multiple ways of calculating distance like Euclidean distance, 
Manhattan distance etc.
